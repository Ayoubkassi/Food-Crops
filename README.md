**The main purpose of this project was to implement existing UML diagrams using Factory Design Pattern**

## Factory Design Pattern 

**as we were saying factory is a cretional design pattern and he is one of the most used design patterns in all programming languages**

* This pattern define an interface(abstarct class in python) to define an object
* when a class needs to instanstiate a subclass of another class but , doesn't know how
* the factory method is used in a lot of frameworks
* frameworks use always abstarct classes
 
Example : 

* suppose u have two different type of televisions one with a led screen and another with lcd screen , if either of tvs strat mallfunctioning u must call a tv repairing , but the repair man must know which type of tv he will fix first , and in dependent on ur input he will bring diffrent requirements
